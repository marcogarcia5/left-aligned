            <h2>User Research Project</h2>
            <p>A group of four of us collaborated on a project to re-design the information architecture of the PCC Natural Market website. This was a course project that focused on User Research methods to build a more fluid user interaction with the site.</p>
            <p>The scope of the project was to catalogue the current information architecture, analyze the interaction design, conduct research with a focus group, and return with suggestions the help improve user experience.</p>
            <p>Our methods and findings can be found in the our final report, including a recorded session of a participant study.</p>
