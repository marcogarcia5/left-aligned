# left-aligned
Hi all,
This is my portfolio website, www.left-aligned.com. My code is available to anyone who wishes to see it. I have omitted any private registration information as well as code for external sites. The heirarchy is a little different when looking at the style, script, and include files. These would normally sit in their respective directories at the root level.

As an entry level web developer, I would greatly appreciate any feedback and suggestions.

thanks,
Marco
